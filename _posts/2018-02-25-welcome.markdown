Hey,

I'm Thom and I've started this blog to document my learnings on cyber security topics. I will be uploading posts as I complete tasks between my studies. 
My first post should be come in a few days and will be on the Kioptrix Level 2 solution. I completed Kioptrix Level 1 before I thought of starting this blog, I will likely return to write-up how I completed it.

Hope you enjoy my posts!
