Apologies for the gap in posts, I've been without internet for close to two weeks but I've finally been switched on to NBN! 

Yesterday and today, I've been getting back into <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox!</a> I've fallen back in love with it and already learnt a few new techniques. 

The community is as helpful as ever, making sure you can get a foothold if you get stuck, without spoiling too much for you. 

My HTB Badge is:
