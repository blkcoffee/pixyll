Hey everyone,

I've found a new site made for penetration testing called <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox.eu</a>. This is the most full-featured site I've found for self-teaching pentesting and has a fantastic community built around it.

One of the coolest parts of joining HackTheBox is having to "hack" the invite code to be able to join, a cool way to ensure people joining have a basic understanding of what they're getting into.

There are 20 machines available for users to gain user and root access on. These machines are rated by users who have completed them on a 1-10 scale, this gives you an idea of the difficulty of each machine. Machines are retired and replaced by newer machines, so you aren't likely to run out of machines to hack.

As well as the vulnerable machines available, HackTheBox has a range of challenges to help you improve in fields such as crypto, reversing, stego, web, forensics, and more. 

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the website, I can't upload any of the walkthroughs or tutorials as the machines I have completed are all still active. Once they get retired I will be posting them to this blog!

I've really been enjoying my time using HackTheBox to teach myself new methods and skills and would recommend giving it a shot.

Thanks, and good luck hacking.
