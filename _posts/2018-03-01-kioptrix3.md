Today we are going to look at how I solved the third Kioptrix machine! 

So as before, we load the VM into VMware and launch it. This is the screen we are greeted with: 

![Kioptrix 3](/assets/K3/K3.PNG){: .center-image }

Back in our Kali machine, let's run an nmap scan of the network. 

![K3 nmap](/assets/K3/K3_nmap.PNG){: .center-image }

Okay so there are only two ports open, this is already more challenging than Kioptrix 2! Let's jump onto Kioptrix3.com and check it out

![K3 landingpage](/assets/K3/K3_landingpage.PNG){: .center-image }

So the first thing that pops out to me here is the "Login" page

![K3 weblogin](/assets/K3/K3_weblogin.PNG){: .center-image }

Unfortunately, the sqlmap trick we used on logins in Kioptrix2 didn't work here...

So back to the landing page and lets see what other vulnerabilities we can find!

There's a gallery they just launched! Let's take a look at that. Not much when you go into a photo album at first

![K3 gallery](/assets/K3/K3_gallerybeforesort.PNG){: .center-image }

But once you sort the images we have a more interesting web URL. 

Let's sqlmap this with the parameter 'id' to see what comes up! To do that we go to terminal and type:

{% highlight ruby %}
sqlmap -u http://kioptrix.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1 -p id
{% endhighlight %}

These are the results: 

![K3 sqlmapvulns](/assets/K3/K3_sqlmapvulns.PNG){: .center-image }

Let's now run a second sqlmap (because I forgot to append --columns to the first search) and find what Tables and columns this SQL Database has

![K3 sqlmapcolumns](/assets/K3/K3_sqlmapcolumns.PNG){: .center-image }

There's a VERY interesting table there, dev_accounts. That sounds like it might help us get further into this machine. Let's target that.

Back in terminal we run another sqlmap command, this time targeting the dev_accounts table 

{% highlight ruby %}
sqlmap -u http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1 -D 'gallery' -T 'dev_accounts' --dump
{% endhighlight %}
<br>
-D for database<br>
-T for table<br>
--dump to dump out all the table data
<br>
So when this runs it's going to ask a few questions relating to the stored password hashes. I decided to store them in a temp file just in case. Sqlmap has the function to run a dictionary attack on the hashed passwords for us using it's own dictionary, handy!

Now that is done we are presented with:

![K3 sqlpwcracked](/assets/K3/K3_sqlpasswordcracked.PNG){: .center-image }

So we have dreg and loneferret and their passwords. Let's try to SSH into kioptrix3.com with their credentials.

Success!



I check what sudo permissions dreg has. 


dreg has none, that's not good to us. 

Let's exit and login as loneferret

![K3 loneferret](/assets/K3/K3_loneferretsudo.PNG){: .center-image }

Okay, loneferret has some. Let's run them and see what we have

ht is a terminal, this is gold!! Let's go through the file system and try to get ourselves root access.

![K3 congrats](/assets/K3/K3_congratstxt.PNG){: .center-image }

Think I've found my trophy before I've even got proper root access! I want to change root user password before I call this a true victory.

So back in /etc/ I find the sudoers file and give loneferret the same permissions as root. 


Back in the terminal I can now change root password and log in to the Kioptrix3 VM!

Thanks!
